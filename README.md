This project aims to find an optimal solution to the ‘K-route inspection’ problem and is inspired by Rickey Gates’ ‘Every Single Street’ project. 

The idea is to create a graph of Nodes and edges from a representative map of San Francisco, and program an algorithm capable of visiting every single edge (or street) in the graph. 

This project has several constrains, some similar, some different, to the original projects’ inspiration. 

Firstly, the goal is to minimise to the number of days required to traverse a city like San Francisco. 

Secondly, there is a distance cap of 26.2 miles per day for travel. 

Thirdly, we are limited to a single anchor node that serves as both the starting and ending node for each day.
